I am a master student at [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html), and an incoming Ph.D. student at the same department where I will start working with Professor [Daniele Panozzo](https://cims.nyu.edu/gcl/daniele.html) in Fall 2022. Prior to NYU, I got my Bachelor's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring in Computer Science. My research interests include Computer Graphics, Geometirc Processing and Similation.
