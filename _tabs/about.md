I am a master student at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, and an incoming Ph.D. student at the same department where I will work with Professor [Daniele Panozzo](https://cims.nyu.edu/gcl/daniele.html) in Fall 2022. Prior to NYU, I got my Bachelor's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interests include Computer Graphics, Geometirc Processing and Similation.
